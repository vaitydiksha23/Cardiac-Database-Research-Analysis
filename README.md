Cardiac Database Research Analysis

This project provides key insights that would indicate which patients are more likely to suffer heart disease. The data is cleaned and pre-processed using SQL in MS SQL Server Management Studio and MS Excel.
The dataset provided a number of indicators linked to the risk of heart disease which have been included in an interactive dashboard using parameters and calculated fields to filter data and allow users to manipulate data in the most appropriate manner.
